# Deep Learning for Car Detection with YOLOv11

## Overview
This project implements a **YOLOv11**-based object detection model for **car detection in low-light conditions**.  
The model was fine-tuned on a custom low-light car dataset to improve detection performance in challenging environments.

---

## Model Architecture
We use the **Ultralytics YOLOv11** object detection framework, leveraging its state-of-the-art speed and accuracy for real-time detection.  

Key features:
- Pretrained weights for faster convergence.
- Fine-tuned on low-light car images.
- Optimized for bounding box localization and object classification.
